# Document360 API CRUD Operations

This project demonstrates how to interact with the Document360 API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on drive folders.

## 📋 Task Overview

This console application implements 4 main API operations:
- **GET** - Fetch all drive folders
- **POST** - Create a new drive folder
- **PUT** - Update folder name
- **DELETE** - Remove folder

## 🛠️ Language and Tools Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `requests` - For HTTP API calls
  - `json` - For JSON data handling
  - `datetime` - For timestamps

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd document360-api-crud
```

2. **Install required packages**:
```bash
pip install requests
```

3. **Get your credentials**:
   - **API Key**: Your Document360 API key
   - **User ID**: Your Document360 user ID
   - (Your company should have provided both of these)

4. **Configure your credentials**:
   - Open `document360_api.py`
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:
   ```python
   API_TOKEN = "your_actual_api_key_here"    # Replace with your API key
   USER_ID = "your_actual_user_id_here"      # Replace with your user ID
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
document360-api-crud/
├── document360_api.py      # Main application file
├── README.md              # This file
└── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. **Run the main program**:
```bash
python document360_api.py
```

2. **The program will automatically**:
   - Fetch all existing folders (GET)
   - Create a new test folder (POST)
   - Rename the created folder (PUT)
   - Delete the folder (DELETE)

## 📊 Expected Output

The program will display detailed logs for each operation:

## 🔧 Features Implemented

### Core Requirements
- ✅ Console application in Python
- ✅ Individual methods for each CRUD operation
- ✅ Standard naming conventions
- ✅ Proper request headers with api_token
- ✅ Detailed logging of requests and responses
- ✅ Dynamic folder ID storage and reuse
- ✅ Modular and readable code with comments

### Bonus Features
- ✅ Response validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ HTTP status code validation
- ✅ JSON response structure validation
- ✅ Request timeout handling
- ✅ Detailed documentation

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never commit your actual API key or user ID to version control
- These credentials should be stored in environment variables in production
- Current implementation is for demonstration purposes only

## 📝 API Endpoints Used

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/v2/Drive/Folders` | Fetch all folders |
| POST   | `/v2/Drive/Folders` | Create new folder |
| PUT    | `/v2/Drive/Folders/{id}` | Update folder name |
| DELETE | `/v2/Drive/Folders/{id}` | Delete folder |

## 🐛 Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid API tokens
- Invalid folder IDs
- API rate limiting
- Invalid JSON responses
- HTTP timeout errors

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

1. **Dynamic Folder ID Management**: The application stores the created folder ID and reuses it for update and delete operations.

2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Every request and response is logged with timestamps, headers, and full body content.

3. **Modular Design**: Each CRUD operation is implemented as a separate method in the `Document360API` class.

4. **Error Resilience**: Proper try-catch blocks and status code validation ensure the application handles errors gracefully.

## 📈 Sample Test Flow

1. **GET**: Retrieves existing folders to understand current state
2. **POST**: Creates a new folder with timestamp-based name
3. **PUT**: Updates the folder name by appending "Updated" prefix
4. **DELETE**: Removes the created folder to clean up

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check your API token is correct
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed
4. Check the Document360 API documentation for any updates

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

This implementation successfully demonstrates:
- REST API integration skills
- Error handling and logging
- Clean code structure
- Documentation skills
- Understanding of HTTP methods and status codes
